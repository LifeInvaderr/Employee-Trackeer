## How I started this project
With this project, I began working with the Database. As during the module work, and my tutor session it was mentioned that once I completed the database formating and seeds, I wouldn't have make changes after completion.

The difficulty with working with the Database was moderate. I often had to use the mySQL shell in the terminal to root out the bugs, and drop and source the database constantly. It was a slow process, but fairly simple.

## What I had struggled with
In this project I had struggled primarily the functions to call for information from the database to use them for the prompts. As I often would have to use the mySQL shell in the terminal to weed out the bugs.

I was struggling as well with time management. As I was writing code and testing if the code ran. In the middle of working on the app.js, I remembered that to be more effective, I would need to write enough code to pass, debug, then refactor.

Although my code is functional, I haven't had the time to refactor.

## What I had learned
With this challenge, I have learned that with programming. I should apply the strategy of writing enough code to pass, then debug. As I found that I was the most productive after setting my code up.

## What I would change
With this challenge, if I had managed my time more effectively from the start, I would most definitly refactor all of my code.

With each choice from the mainMenu prompt, each function called on is formatted differently. As I was experimenting with what I could do with functions in getting what works, there is a lot unused call functions in my code.

I would want to make my code more uniformed, and use much less code.
